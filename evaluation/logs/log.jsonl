Although still in its early years, this technology has showed promise as a possible means of attaining negative emissions\u2014that is, where more CO2 is taken out of the environment than is released [1]. By sending air through a system designed to remove CO2 and either bury it underground or use it for industrial purposes, carbon capture devices operate Although present carbon capture technologies are costly and energy-intensive, continuous research aims to make the process more scalable and reasonably priced [1]. For example, Harvard engineer\n\neffect even further, therefore strengthening the resilience and energy economy of cities. Concurrent with this, the evolution of technology such as direct air carbon capture offers a window into the future of carbon elimination, so affording hope that we can not only slow but also reverse the negative consequences of climate change. Though obstacles still exist, our efforts to build a sustainable future depend on ongoing innovation and cooperation among engineers, scientists, and legislators. Working together to use these ideas will help us to significantly solve one of the most important worldwide issues of our day.

This process, sometimes referred to as ocean acidification, presents a great threat to marine life particularly coral, molluscs, and some plankton that create their shells or skeletons from calcium carbonate. Rising acidity makes it more difficult for these species to create and preserve their shells, which raises their mortality rates. Particularly threatened are coral reefs like Great Barrier Reef, sometimes known as the \"rainforests of the ocean\" because of their great richness. The various marine life that relies on reefs for food and protection suffers as they deteriorate, therefore\n\nas invading oceans endanger their basic survival (NOAA, 2024). Furthermore, rising sea levels cause storm surges during typhoons and hurricanes to become more severe, resulting in population displacement, damage of infrastructure and death.

One key feedback loop involves the melting of ice sheets. As ice sheets melt, they expose darker land and ocean surfaces, leading to increased absorption of solar radiation, thereby amplifying warming. Rising sea levels also increase the severity of storms, causing additional damage and displacement. Furthermore, warming oceans harm marine ecosystems, ultimately endangering the basic survival of species that inhabit them. These feedback loops create a self-reinforcing cycle, contributing to the acceleration of global warming.", "group_id": "default"}

This sequence of chemical processes lowers the pH, making it more acidic. This rising acidity is especially harmful to marine life that creates their shells or skeletons from calcium carbonate, such as coral, molluscs, and some plankton.\n\nThe main reason ocean acidification is harmful to coral reefs is that it makes it more difficult for these species to build and maintain their calcium carbonate shells and skeletons.
