Comments on this topic of risk and uncertainty have emerged, spanning from AR1 to AR4. Through Manning (2014), the IPCC released a report explaining and validating the approach regarding AR3, addressing several topics. Among them, two key issues were \"likelihood\" and \"confidence\" as alternative ways of expressing uncertainty. Jonassen & Pielke (2011) examine the treatment in AR4. It highlights inconsistencies in the conveyance of uncertainties across the different Working Groups (WGs), emphasizing the need for improved consistency, clarity, and systematic treatment of uncertainties in"}

Microfinance institutions (MFIs) can be likened to these too-big-to-fail entities, given their crucial role in providing financing to various levels of the lower-income population.
