For example, Harvard engineer Aaron Sabin is creating a new method for carbon capture that separates CO2 from the air using electrochemical techniques. Sabin is a potential large-scale deployment [1] solution since her approach uses more energy than conventional heat-based carbon capture technologies. As such technologies advance, they may become rather important in lowering"}

Although solar and wind power among other renewable energy sources is quite important in lowering greenhouse gas emissions, their quick implementation must be given top priority if we are to reach world climate targets. Likewise, developments in hybrid and electric cars as well as in transportation infrastructure have great possibilities to reduce emissions, especially in the very polluting aviation industry.
